"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster." This research aims to use machine learning techniques on the Titanic data to analyze the data for classification and to predict the survival of the Titanic passengers by using data-mining algorithms; specifically Decision Trees and Na√Øve Bayes.The prediction and efficiency of these algorithms depend greatly on data analysis and the model.
